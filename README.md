Complete; Flarum version 0.1.0-beta6. Spanish (Spain). Español (España), pt-PT

## Installation:

### Using composer (recommended):

Flarum use Composer to manage its dependencies and extensions. The Spanish language pack is available on Packagist and can be managed that way. Make sure that Composer is installed on your machine, then run the following command in the location where Flarum is installed:

`composer require zeokat/flarum-ext-spanish`

The same command can be used to update independently the Spanish language pack, without updating anything else. Note that because the Spanish language pack will be added as a Flarum's dependency, it will also be automatically updated when updating Flarum and its dependencies via Composer.
